      "contents": "\r\nIntroduction to the Module\r\nHi, my name is Jacqueline. I’m a master’s student in Crop Sciences at the University of Bonn. This is my learning logbook for the module “Tree phenology analysis with R”. This module provides an overview of methods to study the impact of climate and climate change on tree phenology. It is designed for those who may not yet be familiar with phenology or how to analyze climate change effects, but it also aims to offer new insights for those with existing knowledge in these areas. Initially developed for M.Sc. students in Crop Science and Agricultural Science and Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics (ARTS) at the University of Bonn, the material is accessible to anyone interested.\r\nThe content begins with an introduction to phenology (with a special emphasis on dormancy) as well as an overview of climate change. It then focuses heavily on the practical application of the chillR package for R. This tool has been continuously developed since 2013 by Prof. Dr. Eike Lüdeling, head of the HortiBonn research group at the Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES) at the University of Bonn, to support this type of analysis.\r\nLearning goals\r\nThis course will offer the following skills and experiences:\r\nKnowledge about phenology\r\nKnowledge about tree dormancy\r\nUnderstanding of climate change impact projection methods\r\nAppreciation for the importance of risks and uncertainty in climate change projection\r\nUnderstanding of how to use some staple tools of R code development\r\nAbility to use chillR functions for climate change impact projection\r\nAbility to use chillR functions for tree phenology analysis\r\nUnderstanding and ability to use the PhenoFlex dormancy analysis framework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
