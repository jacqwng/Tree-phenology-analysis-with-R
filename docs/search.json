It takes hourly temperature data as input and, by default, provides the cumulative amount of chilling accumulated over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilling_Hours(Winters_hours_gaps$Temp)[1:100]\r\n\r\n  [1]  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  2  2  2  3  4  5\r\n [22]  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6\r\n [43]  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  6  7  8\r\n [64]  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16\r\n [85] 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 25 25 25 25 25 25\r\n\r\nThe result will show the first 100 values, where the cumulative chilling hours increase as the temperature falls within the specified range.\r\nUtah Model\r\nThe Utah Model assigns different weights to various temperature ranges, reflecting their impact on chill accumulation. The Utah_Model() function in chillR calculates these weighted chilling contributions for each hour of temperature data. The output will show the Utah model values for the first 100 hours, where positive, zero, and negative weights are applied based on the temperature:\r\n\r\n\r\nUtah_Model(Winters_hours_gaps$Temp)[1:100]\r\n\r\n  [1]  0.0 -0.5 -1.5 -2.5 -3.5 -4.5 -5.5 -6.0 -6.0 -6.0 -5.5 -5.0 -4.0\r\n [14] -3.0 -2.0 -1.0  0.0  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5  4.5  5.0  5.0  5.0  4.0\r\n [27]  3.0  2.0  1.0  0.0 -1.0 -2.0 -2.5 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5  0.5\r\n [40]  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.0  4.0  3.5  2.5  1.5\r\n [53]  0.5 -0.5 -1.5 -2.5 -3.0 -3.0 -2.5 -1.5 -0.5  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5\r\n [66]  4.5  5.5  6.5  7.5  8.5  9.5 10.0 10.0  9.5  9.0  8.5  8.0  7.5\r\n [79]  7.0  6.5  6.5  7.0  7.5  8.5  9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5\r\n [92] 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.0 19.0 19.0 18.5 17.5 16.5\r\n\r\nCreating Custom Chill Models with step_model()\r\nThe step_model() function, part of the chillR package, enables the creation of custom chill models based on temperature thresholds and weights. This process involves defining a data frame that specifies temperature ranges and their corresponding weights. Here’s an example of a data frame that defines temperature ranges and their corresponding weights:\r\n\r\n\r\ndf <- data.frame(\r\n  lower = c(-1000, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,    6),\r\n  upper = c(    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1000),\r\n  weight = c(   0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1,    0))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower\r\n\r\n\r\nupper\r\n\r\n\r\nweight\r\n\r\n\r\n-1000\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n1000\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\nA function called custom() implements a chill model based on this data frame.

This function can be easily applied to the Winters_hours_gaps dataset, producing output that displays dynamic chill values for the first 100 hours, reflecting the underlying physiological processes:\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamic_Model(Winters_hours_gaps$Temp)[1:100]\r\n\r\n  [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n  [7] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [13] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [19] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [25] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [31] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [37] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [43] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [49] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [55] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [61] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n [67] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.9698435\r\n [73] 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435\r\n [79] 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435\r\n [85] 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435\r\n [91] 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435\r\n [97] 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435 0.9698435\r\n\r\nChilling and tempResponse functions\r\nThe chillR package offers several functions for analyzing hourly temperature data, including wrapper functions that enable the computation of chill between specific start and end dates. The chilling() function automatically calculates various basic metrics, including Chilling Hours, Utah Model, Dynamic Model, and Growing Degree Hours. It is important to use the make_JDay() function to add Julian dates (which count the days of the year) to the dataset, ensuring proper functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nchill_output <- chilling(make_JDay(Winters_hours_gaps), Start_JDay = 90, End_JDay = 100)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeason\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd_year\r\n\r\n\r\nSeason_days\r\n\r\n\r\nData_days\r\n\r\n\r\nPerc_complete\r\n\r\n\r\nChilling_Hours\r\n\r\n\r\nUtah_Model\r\n\r\n\r\nChill_portions\r\n\r\n\r\nGDH\r\n\r\n\r\n2007/2008\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n100\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\n\r\n15.5\r\n\r\n\r\n2.009147\r\n\r\n\r\n2406.52\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be instances where not all metrics are desired, or there is a need for different metrics altogether.

      "contents": "\r\nClimate change refers to long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns. While these changes can occur naturally — such as fluctuations in solar activity — since the 19th century, climate change has primarily been driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\r\nBefore using chillR, there’s a brief overview of climate change, because the upcoming work will mainly focus on predicting how global warming might affect phenology-related metrics.\r\nThe drivers of climate change\r\nTo understand what’s happening to our planet, it’s important to know the main causes of climate change. This helps us spot false claims that things like the sun, cities, or natural changes in the climate are the main reasons for global warming. The truth is simple: human-made greenhouse gas emissions are heating up our planet, and the only way to stop this is to greatly reduce these emissions.\r\nThe video below, titled Climate Change 1 - Drivers of Climate Change, is the first in a series of four videos on the topic of climate change presented by Eike Lüdeling. It provides a comprehensive overview of the primary drivers of global climate change, such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar radiation, ozone, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s already known\r\nThe next video, Climate Change 2 - Recent Warming, explores climatic changes that have already occurred or for which there is substantial evidence. It demonstrates that the planet has experienced significant warming for several decades, almost globally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture scenarios\r\nWhen it comes to climate change, the most severe impacts are still ahead. This is largely due to the significantly higher rate of greenhouse gas emissions observed over the past few decades, with no signs of a slowdown in the near future. As a result, the human-induced ‘forcing’ effect on our climate has reached unprecedented levels, making it likely that future changes will occur even more rapidly than those we have already witnessed. The next video Climate Change 3 - Future scenarios introduces the methods that climate scientists employ to forecast future conditions and presents climate scenarios developed by these scientists, which researchers in other fields can use to project the impacts of climate change on ecological and agricultural systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact projections approaches\r\nHaving robust climate scenarios is essential, but they only take us partway toward reliable assessments of climate change impacts. A potentially greater challenge lies in translating these climate scenarios into biological consequences. To achieve this, we need impact models or other methods to derive the impacts of climate change. The last video Climate change 4 - impact projection approaches introduces various methods for projecting climate impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises on climate change\r\nList the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.\r\nThe main drivers of climate change on a decade-to-century scale include:\r\nGreenhouse Gases (GHGs): GHGs like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to the greenhouse effect, which raises Earth’s temperature. The increase in these gases is primarily due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and deforestation\r\nAerosols: Particles in the atmosphere that can cool the climate by reflecting sunlight. They come from both natural sources (e.g. sea salt, dust, volcanic eruptions, fires) and human activities (e.g.power plants, cars, fires and cook stove). They are major climate driver in industrial centers (e.g. China)\r\nSun: Solar radiation heats the Earth, with minor fluctuations occurring over time due to cycles in solar activity, such as sunspots. Although these variations contribute only a small portion to the current climate changes, they play a significant role in driving climate change over geological timescales\r\nOzone: Ozone in the stratosphere protects Earth from UV-B radiation, while tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas and contributes to warming\r\nSurface albedo: The reflectivity of the Earth’s surface affects how much solar energy is absorbed. Light surfaces (like ice) reflect more energy, while dark surfaces (like forests or oceans) absorb more, influencing the planet’s heat balance. Changes in surface reflectivity, such as melting ice and snow, decrease the albedo effect, leading to more heat absorption and further warming\r\nThe currently most important driver of climate change is greenhouse gases, particularly CO₂. The mechanism through which CO₂ affects the climate involves the greenhouse effect: CO₂ molecules in the atmosphere absorb long-wave radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface and re-radiate it in all directions, including back toward the surface. This process traps heat and increases global temperatures, driving many of the changes we observe in climate patterns.\r\nExplain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.\r\nIn recent decades, global temperatures have been rising at a faster rate than at any other time in human history. This trend is evident from the fact that the hottest years on record have all occurred within the last few decades. One striking example is the extreme heat in Siberia in the spring of 2020, where temperatures were up to 8°C above the recent average. This trend is particularly concerning because it is mainly driven by human activities, especially the emission of greenhouse gases. Unlike previous climate changes, which took place slowly over long periods, today’s fast rise in temperatures increases the risk of triggering dangerous effects, like melting permafrost and losing ice cover, which could make global warming even worse. Even a small increase of 1.5°C could seriously upset the balance of our climate, showing how important it is to take action against these human-caused changes.\r\nWhat does the abbreviation ‘RCP’ stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?\r\nRCP stands for Representative Concentration Pathways, which are essential scenarios used in climate modeling to project potential future greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts on the climate. RCPs are defined by the level of radiative forcing — measured in watts per square meter (W/m²) — that is expected by the end of the 21st century. Each pathway corresponds to a specific amount of greenhouse gas concentrations, which can significantly influence global temperatures. The role of RCPs is to serve as inputs for climate models, helping to produce future climate scenarios, which are essential for understanding the potential impacts of climate change and planning appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies.\r\nBriefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.\r\nThe four climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video are:\r\nStatistical models: These models establish relationships between climate parameters and impact measures, such as crop yield. They use historical data to explain past trends and project future climate impacts. Their primary limitation is that the statistical relationships may not remain valid under future climate conditions, and they may overlook important factors\r\nSpecies Distribution Modeling: Also known as ecological niche modeling, this method predicts the future distribution of species by relating current presence or absence data to climatic parameters. However, these models may assume species are in equilibrium with the climate, which is often not the case\r\nProcess based models: These models aim to represent all major system processes using equations, capturing the scientific knowledge of processes like crop growth, phenology or hydrology. However, they are limited by the lack of complete understanding of complex systems, and often require extensive parameterization or assumptions\r\nClimate Analogue models: This method identifies current locations with climates similar to those expected in the future at another site, offering real-world examples that can guide adaptation strategies. However, they may be limited by differences in non-climatic factors and lack of suitable data, making it difficult to draw clear conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This tool has been continuously developed since 2013 by Prof. Dr. Eike Lüdeling, head of the HortiBonn research group at the Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES) at the University of Bonn, to support this type of analysis.\r\nThis course will offer the following skills and experiences:\r\nKnowledge about phenology\r\nKnowledge about tree dormancy\r\nUnderstanding of climate change impact projection methods\r\nAppreciation for the importance of risks and uncertainty in climate change projection\r\nUnderstanding of how to use some staple tools of R code development\r\nAbility to use chillR functions for climate change impact projection\r\nAbility to use chillR functions for tree phenology analysis\r\nUnderstanding and ability to use the PhenoFlex dormancy analysis framework\r\nTools\r\nThis course is designed to provide knowledge about tree phenology, climate change, and related topics, along with hands-on exercises to demonstrate the functionalities of the chillR package. It is recommended to document everything learned in a learning logbook. To engage in these practical components effectively, various tools are required. Since chillR is an R package, using R, preferably through the RStudio interface, will be necessary.\r\nAlthough it is possible to run RStudio on a local computer and save files directly on the hard drive, this approach differs from the methods commonly used by professional programmers. To align with standard programming practices, familiarity with certain code development tools is essential. This course will therefore cover the basics of using Git and GitHub, which are valuable tools for organizing, securing, and sharing code. Additionally, proper documentation techniques in R will be introduced, focusing on creating well-structured, professional reports using RMarkdown. While these tools may seem complex at first, their usefulness is likely to become clearer as they are used throughout the module.\r\nDr. Cory Whitney, a researcher at HortiBonn, has volunteered to create tutorial videos to provide an introduction to these tools.\r\nR and RStudio\r\nThe first video Using R and RStudio demonstrates how to install and run R and RStudio:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGit and Github\r\nThe next video Using Git and Github explores the programming version control environment Git and the interface GitHub, which is used to access these features:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRmarkdown\r\nIn the last video Using R Mardown, R Markdown will be examined, a powerful tool that enables the creation of sophisticated reports, websites, and more from R code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This approach is especially crucial for calculating the Chilling Hours.\r\nExercises on hourly temperatures\r\nChoose a location of interest, find out its latitude and produce plots of daily sunrise, sunset and daylength.\r\nThe Yakima Valley in Washington State, USA, is located at about 46.6° N latitude. This region has a continental climate with cold winters and hot, dry summers, creating ideal conditions for growing fruit trees. The valley is well known for producing a variety of fruits, including apples, cherries, pears, and grapes, which benefit from its distinct seasonal changes.

      "contents": "\r\nThis chapter explains how to calculate Chilling Hours using R and the chillR package. Chilling Hours measure the number of hours where temperatures are between 0°C and 7.2°C, which is important for certain plants to meet their cold requirements during dormancy and grow properly.\r\nData Requirements\r\nThe calculation requires hourly temperature data, which is not always available. The chillR package provides tools to approximate data from daily records. In this example, the dataset Winters_hours_gaps is used, containing hourly temperature data recorded in 2008 from a walnut orchard in Winters, California.\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe chillR package is loaded using library(chillR). The relevant columns (year, month, day, hour, temperature) are extracted and stored in a new dataset named hourtemps, ensuring the correct format for calculating Chilling Hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nhourtemps <- Winters_hours_gaps[,c(\"Year\",\r\n                                   \"Month\",\r\n                                   \"Day\",\r\n                                   \"Hour\",\r\n                                   \"Temp\")]\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Calculation of Chilling Hours\r\nChilling Hours are defined as any hour where the temperature falls between 0°C and 7.2°C. In R, this is implemented using a logical condition:\r\n\r\n\r\nhourtemps[, \"Chilling_Hour\"] <- hourtemps$Temp >= 0 & hourtemps$Temp <= 7.2\r\n\r\n\r\nA new column Chilling_Hour (TRUE/FALSE) is created to indicate whether a given hour qualifies. The total number of Chilling Hours can then be calculated using sum(hourtemps$Chilling_Hour).\r\nAutomation with Functions\r\nTo simplify the process, a function CH() was created to automatically add the Chilling_Hour column:\r\n\r\n\r\nCH <- function(hourtemps) {\r\n  hourtemps[, \"Chilling_Hour\"] <- hourtemps$Temp >= 0 & hourtemps$Temp <= 7.2\r\n  return(hourtemps)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a function sum_CH() was developed to calculate the total number of Chilling Hours between two specific dates:\r\n\r\n\r\nsum_CH <- function(hourtemps, Start_Year, Start_Month, Start_Day, Start_Hour, \r\n                              End_Year, End_Month, End_Day, End_Hour) {\r\n  hourtemps[,\"Chilling_Hour\"] <- hourtemps$Temp >= 0 & hourtemps$Temp <= 7.2\r\n\r\n  Start_Index <- which(hourtemps$Year == Start_Year & hourtemps$Month == Start_Month &\r\n                       hourtemps$Day == Start_Day & hourtemps$Hour == Start_Hour)\r\n  End_Index <- which(hourtemps$Year == End_Year & hourtemps$Month == End_Month &\r\n                     hourtemps$Day == End_Day & hourtemps$Hour == End_Hour)\r\n\r\n  CHs <- sum(hourtemps$Chilling_Hour[Start_Index:End_Index])\r\n  return(CHs)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis function uses the which() function to identify the relevant rows in the dataset based on the selected time range.\r\nOptimization of Function Parameters\r\nInstead of passing year, month, day, and hour separately, compact strings in the format YEARMODAHO (e.g., 2008040100 for April 1, 2008, at 00:00) can be used. The function extracts values using substr() and converts them into numeric values.\r\n\r\n\r\nsum_CH <- function(hourtemps, startYEARMODAHO, endYEARMODAHO) {\r\n  hourtemps[, \"Chilling_Hour\"] <- hourtemps$Temp >= 0 & hourtemps$Temp <= 7.2\r\n\r\n  startYear <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 1, 4))\r\n  startMonth <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 5, 6))\r\n  startDay <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 7, 8))\r\n  startHour <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 9, 10))\r\n\r\n  endYear <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 1, 4))\r\n  endMonth <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 5, 6))\r\n  endDay <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 7, 8))\r\n  endHour <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 9, 10))\r\n\r\n  Start_Index <- which(hourtemps$Year == startYear & hourtemps$Month == startMonth &\r\n                       hourtemps$Day == startDay & hourtemps$Hour == startHour)\r\n  End_Index <- which(hourtemps$Year == endYear & hourtemps$Month == endMonth &\r\n                     hourtemps$Day == endDay & hourtemps$Hour == endHour)\r\n\r\n  CHs <- sum(hourtemps$Chilling_Hour[Start_Index:End_Index])\r\n  return(CHs)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication Example\r\nUsing the function sum_CH(), it was calculated that between April 1st and October 11th, 2008, the walnut orchard experienced 77 Chilling Hours:\r\n\r\n\r\nsum_CH(hourtemps, startYEARMODAHO = 2008040100, endYEARMODAHO = 2008101100)\r\n\r\n[1] 77\r\n\r\nExercises on basic chill modeling\r\nWrite a basic function that calculates warm hours (>25°C).\r\n\r\n\r\nWH <- function(data)\r\n  {data[, \"Warm_Hour\"] <- data$Temp > 25\r\n  return(data)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nApply this function to the Winters_hours_gaps dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nWH(Winters_hours_gaps)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYear\r\n\r\n\r\nMonth\r\n\r\n\r\nDay\r\n\r\n\r\nHour\r\n\r\n\r\nTemp_gaps\r\n\r\n\r\nTemp\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm_Hour\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\n15.127\r\n\r\n\r\n15.127\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n17.153\r\n\r\n\r\n17.153\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\n18.699\r\n\r\n\r\n18.699\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\n18.699\r\n\r\n\r\n18.699\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\n18.842\r\n\r\n\r\n18.842\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\n19.508\r\n\r\n\r\n19.508\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\n19.318\r\n\r\n\r\n19.318\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\n17.701\r\n\r\n\r\n17.701\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\n15.414\r\n\r\n\r\n15.414\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\n12.727\r\n\r\n\r\n12.727\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE\r\n\r\n\r\nExtend this function, so that it can take start and end dates as inputs and sums up warm hours between these dates.\r\n\r\n\r\nsum_WH <- function(data, \r\n                   startYEARMODAHO,\r\n                   endYEARMODAHO)\r\n  \r\n{data[,\"Warm_Hour\"] <- data$Temp > 25\r\n\r\nstartYear <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 1, 4))\r\nstartMonth <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 5, 6))\r\nstartDay <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 7, 8))\r\nstartHour <- as.numeric(substr(startYEARMODAHO, 9, 10))\r\n\r\nendYear <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 1, 4))\r\nendMonth <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 5, 6))\r\nendDay <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 7, 8))\r\nendHour <- as.numeric(substr(endYEARMODAHO, 9, 10))\r\n\r\n\r\nStart_Date <- which(data$Year == startYear &\r\n                    data$Month == startMonth &\r\n                    data$Day == startDay &\r\n                    data$Hour == startHour)\r\n\r\nEnd_Date <- which(data$Year == endYear &\r\n                  data$Month == endMonth &\r\n                  data$Day == endDay &\r\n                  data$Hour == endHour)\r\n\r\nWHs <- sum(data$Warm_Hour[Start_Date:End_Date])\r\nreturn(WHs)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication Example:\r\n\r\n\r\nsum_WH(Winters_hours_gaps, startYEARMODAHO = 2008080100, \r\n                           endYEARMODAHO = 2008083100)\r\n\r\n[1] 283\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August 2008, from the 1st to the 31st, the walnut orchard experienced a total of 283 warm hours (defined as hours when the temperature exceeded 25°C).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A major advantage of the tidyverse is that with a single command – library(tidyverse) – all functions in the package collection become available.\r\nThe ggplot2 package\r\nThe ggplot2 package, first released by Hadley Wickham in 2007, has become one of the most popular R packages because it significantly simplifies the creation of attractive graphics. The package history can be found here, and an introduction with links to various tutorials is available here.\r\nThe tibble package\r\nA tibble is an enhanced version of a data.frame offering several improvements. The most notable improvement is that tibbles avoid the common data.frame behavior of unexpectedly converting strings into factors. Although tibbles are relatively new here, they will be used throughout the rest of the book.\r\nTo create a tibble from a regular data.frame (or a similar structure), the as_tibble command can be used:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndat <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))\r\nd <- as_tibble(dat)\r\nd\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\r\n      a     b\r\n  <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1     1     4\r\n2     2     5\r\n3     3     6\r\n\r\nThe magrittr package - pipes\r\nMagrittr helps organize steps applied to the same dataset by using the pipe operator %>%. This operator links multiple operations on a data structure, such as a tibble, making it easier to perform tasks like calculating the sum of all numbers in the dataset:\r\n\r\n\r\nd %>% sum()\r\n\r\n[1] 21\r\n\r\nAfter the pipe operator %>%, the next function automatically takes the piped-in data as its first input, so it’s unnecessary to specify it explicitly. Additional commands can be chained by adding more pipes, allowing for building more complex workflows, as shown in examples later.\r\nThe tidyr package\r\nThe tidyr package offers helpful functions for organizing data. The KA_weather dataset from chillR will be used here to illustrate some of these functions:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(chillR)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw <- as_tibble(KA_weather[1:10,])\r\nKAw\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1\r\n 2  1998     1     2   9.1   5  \r\n 3  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n 4  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5\r\n 5  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5\r\n 6  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4\r\n 7  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n 8  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n 9  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n10  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n\r\npivot_longer\r\nThe pivot_longer function reshapes data from separate columns (like Tmin and Tmax) into individual rows. This transformation is often necessary for tasks like plotting data with the ggplot2 package. The function can be combined with a pipe for a streamlined workflow:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAwlong <- KAw %>% pivot_longer(cols = Tmax:Tmin)\r\nKAwlong\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 20 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day name  value\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <chr> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1 Tmax    8.2\r\n 2  1998     1     1 Tmin    5.1\r\n 3  1998     1     2 Tmax    9.1\r\n 4  1998     1     2 Tmin    5  \r\n 5  1998     1     3 Tmax   10.4\r\n 6  1998     1     3 Tmin    3.3\r\n 7  1998     1     4 Tmax    8.4\r\n 8  1998     1     4 Tmin    4.5\r\n 9  1998     1     5 Tmax    7.7\r\n10  1998     1     5 Tmin    4.5\r\n11  1998     1     6 Tmax    8.1\r\n12  1998     1     6 Tmin    4.4\r\n13  1998     1     7 Tmax   12  \r\n14  1998     1     7 Tmin    6.9\r\n15  1998     1     8 Tmax   11.2\r\n16  1998     1     8 Tmin    8.6\r\n17  1998     1     9 Tmax   13.9\r\n18  1998     1     9 Tmin    8.5\r\n19  1998     1    10 Tmax   14.5\r\n20  1998     1    10 Tmin    3.6\r\n\r\npivot_wider\r\nThe pivot_wider function allows for the opposite transformation of pivot_longer, converting rows back into separate columns:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAwwide <- KAwlong %>% pivot_wider(names_from = name) \r\nKAwwide\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1\r\n 2  1998     1     2   9.1   5  \r\n 3  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n 4  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5\r\n 5  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5\r\n 6  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4\r\n 7  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n 8  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n 9  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n10  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n\r\nselect\r\nThe select function allows users to choose a subset of columns from a data.frame or tibble:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw %>% select(c(Month, Day, Tmax))\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\r\n   Month   Day  Tmax\r\n   <int> <int> <dbl>\r\n 1     1     1   8.2\r\n 2     1     2   9.1\r\n 3     1     3  10.4\r\n 4     1     4   8.4\r\n 5     1     5   7.7\r\n 6     1     6   8.1\r\n 7     1     7  12  \r\n 8     1     8  11.2\r\n 9     1     9  13.9\r\n10     1    10  14.5\r\n\r\nfilter\r\nThe filter function reduces a data.frame or tibble to just the rows that fulfill certain conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw %>% filter(Tmax > 10)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\r\n   Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n  <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n2  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n3  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n4  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n5  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n\r\nmutate\r\nThe mutate function is essential for creating, modifying, and deleting columns in a data.frame or tibble. For example, it can be used to add new columns, such as converting Tmin and Tmax to Kelvin:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw_K <- KAw %>% mutate(Tmax_K = Tmax + 273.15, Tmin_K = Tmin + 273.15)\r\nKAw_K\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin Tmax_K Tmin_K\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1   281.   278.\r\n 2  1998     1     2   9.1   5     282.   278.\r\n 3  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3   284.   276.\r\n 4  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5   282.   278.\r\n 5  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5   281.   278.\r\n 6  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4   281.   278.\r\n 7  1998     1     7  12     6.9   285.   280.\r\n 8  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6   284.   282.\r\n 9  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5   287.   282.\r\n10  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6   288.   277.\r\n\r\nTo delete the columns created with mutate, you can set them to NULL:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw_K %>% mutate(Tmin_K = NULL, Tmax_K = NULL)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1\r\n 2  1998     1     2   9.1   5  \r\n 3  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n 4  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5\r\n 5  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5\r\n 6  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4\r\n 7  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n 8  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n 9  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n10  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n\r\nNext, the original temperature values will be replaced directly with their corresponding Kelvin values:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw %>% mutate(Tmin = Tmin + 273.15, Tmax = Tmax + 273.15)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     1  281.  278.\r\n 2  1998     1     2  282.  278.\r\n 3  1998     1     3  284.  276.\r\n 4  1998     1     4  282.  278.\r\n 5  1998     1     5  281.  278.\r\n 6  1998     1     6  281.  278.\r\n 7  1998     1     7  285.  280.\r\n 8  1998     1     8  284.  282.\r\n 9  1998     1     9  287.  282.\r\n10  1998     1    10  288.  277.\r\n\r\narrange\r\nThe arrange function sorts data in data.frames or tibbles:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw %>% arrange(Tmax, Tmin)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5\r\n 2  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4\r\n 3  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1\r\n 4  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5\r\n 5  1998     1     2   9.1   5  \r\n 6  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n 7  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n 8  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n 9  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n10  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n\r\nIt can also sort in descending order:\r\n\r\n\r\nKAw %>% arrange(desc(Tmax), Tmin)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\r\n    Year Month   Day  Tmax  Tmin\r\n   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n 1  1998     1    10  14.5   3.6\r\n 2  1998     1     9  13.9   8.5\r\n 3  1998     1     7  12     6.9\r\n 4  1998     1     8  11.2   8.6\r\n 5  1998     1     3  10.4   3.3\r\n 6  1998     1     2   9.1   5  \r\n 7  1998     1     4   8.4   4.5\r\n 8  1998     1     1   8.2   5.1\r\n 9  1998     1     6   8.1   4.4\r\n10  1998     1     5   7.7   4.5\r\n\r\nLoops\r\nUnderstanding loops is essential for efficient coding. Loops enable the repetition of operations multiple times without needing to retype or copy-paste code. There are two primary types of loops: for loops and while loops.\r\nFor loops\r\nIn a for loop, explicit instructions dictate how many times the code inside the loop should be executed, based on a vector or list of elements:\r\n\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:3) print(\"Hello\")\r\n\r\n[1] \"Hello\"\r\n[1] \"Hello\"\r\n[1] \"Hello\"\r\n\r\nThis code executes the loop three times, printing “Hello” each time.

These functions require two key arguments: the list of items to apply the operation to and the operation itself.\r\nsapply\r\nThe sapply function is used to apply an operation to a vector:\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc <- function(x) x + 1\r\nsapply(1:5, func)\r\n\r\n[1] 2 3 4 5 6\r\n\r\nlapply\r\nThe lapply function returns a list as the output, even if the input is a vector:\r\n\r\n\r\nlapply(1:5, func)\r\n\r\n[[1]]\r\n[1] 2\r\n\r\n[[2]]\r\n[1] 3\r\n\r\n[[3]]\r\n[1] 4\r\n\r\n[[4]]\r\n[1] 5\r\n\r\n[[5]]\r\n[1] 6\r\n\r\napply\r\nThe apply function is designed for arrays, allowing operations to be performed either on rows (MARGIN = 1) or columns (MARGIN = 2):\r\n\r\n\r\nmat <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), c(3, 3))\r\napply(mat, MARGIN = 1, sum) #

      "contents": "\r\nThis chapter explores dormancy in temperate fruit trees. This topic remains complex and has many unanswered questions. A central question for researchers is, “How do trees know when to flower?” Although it seems clear that trees bloom in spring, the reality is more complicated. This chapter provides a better understanding of dormancy and demonstrates how to use the chillR tool to predict flowering times, even in the face of challenges posed by global warming.\r\nDormancy definition\r\nTree dormancy is a state of reduced activity that occurs when environmental conditions are unfavorable, especially during winter. This state acts as a survival strategy, helping trees withstand extreme temperatures, water shortages, and other stress factors. During dormancy, trees slow down or stop their growth to conserve energy and avoid damage. Dormancy is a continuous process divided into three phases:\r\nDormancy Establishment\r\nDormancy establishment is the process where temperate trees transition from active growth in summer to a dormant state in autumn. This shift is mainly triggered by shorter daylight hours and decreasing temperatures, causing buds to form, growth to stop, and leaves to fall. The importance of these factors varies by species, with some trees responding more to day length and others to temperature.\r\nEndo-dormancy\r\nEndo-dormancy is a phase of dormancy controlled by the plant’s internal factors, where growth is suppressed even under favorable conditions. It requires a period of cold exposure (chilling) to release the buds from this state, preventing premature growth during temporary warm spells in winter. Low temperatures are the main trigger for breaking endo-dormancy, while the role of light (photoperiod) is still uncertain.\r\nEco-dormancy\r\nEco-dormancy is the phase after endo-dormancy, where buds have regained their ability to grow but remain inactive due to unfavorable environmental conditions, mainly low temperatures. During this phase, growth is on hold until warmer temperatures trigger it. Heat accumulation is needed to resume growth. Eco-dormancy ends when enough heat has been accumulated, leading to visible growth changes, typically in late winter or early spring.\r\nThe below video Introduction to dormancy by Dr. Erica Fadón gives the basic knowledge of this dormancy phases and processes that regulate dormancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDormancy physiology\r\nDormancy as a whole is the result of complex interactions between numerous physiological processes that occur in different parts of the tree, such as buds, twigs, meristems, and vascular tissues. We divide these processes into four main themes:\r\nTransport: occurs at both the whole-plant and cellular levels\r\nPhytohormone Dynamics: behavior and levels of plant hormones during dormancy\r\nGenetic and Epigenetic Regulation: how genetic factors and their modifications influence dormancy\r\nDynamics of Nonstructural Carbohydrates: changes in carbohydrate levels that affect dormancy\r\nThe following figure from the study “A conceptual framework for Winter Dormancy in Deciduous Trees” by Fadón et al. (2015) presents a conceptual framework of winter dormancy in deciduous trees and summarizes the three dormancy phases along with their respective physiological processes.\r\nConceptual framework of winter dormancy in deciduous trees. The dormancy framework (gray background) indicates three main phases: (a) dormancy establishment (light gray), (b) endo-dormancy (dark gray), and (c) eco-dormancy (medium gray). For each phase (a–c), the dormancy-related physiological processes are represented by colored shapes and numbers (0 to 4).All the processes depicted are explained in detail in the video below, Dormancy Physiology by Dr. Erica Fadón.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimental and statistical determination of chilling and forcing periods\r\nDormancy consists of two phases where temperatures have opposite effects on flowering. During endodormancy, higher chill accumulation leads to earlier flowering, whereas similar cool temperatures during ecodormancy can delay flowering. The challenge lies in differentiating between these two phases, as the tree buds appear to be in the same developmental stage throughout. To address this, there are two methods available:\r\nExperimental method: collecting buds periodically during winter, exposing them to favorable growth conditions, and evaluating bud break to determine when dormancy is overcome\r\nStatistical method: uses long-term phenological data and temperature records to estimate the dates of chilling fulfillment and heat accumulation through partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis\r\nThe video Dormancy determination covers the experimental and statistical methods to determine the chilling and forcing periods for temperate fruit trees to overcome dormancy and initiate growth. It explains the concept of dormancy, its phases (endodormancy and ecodormancy), and the temperature requirements for breaking dormancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhenology record and BBCH scale\r\nPhenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycles and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate. This module will involve working with phenology data sets, primarily focusing on a specific stage, usually budbreak, even though trees pass through various developmental stages during the year. These stages are typically identified by numerical codes.\r\nTo describe these growth stages systematically, the BBCH scale is employed. This internationally standardized system outlines the growth and developmental phases of plants. The BBCH scale consists of ten main stages, known as principal growth stages, which are numbered from 0 to 9. Each of these main stages is further divided into substages, enabling a more detailed description of a plant’s development.\r\nPrincipal growth stages:\r\nStage\r\nDescription\r\n0\r\nGermination / sprouting / bud development\r\n1\r\nLeaf development (main shoot)\r\n2\r\nFormation of side shoots / tillering\r\n3\r\nStem elongation or rosette growth / shoot development (main shoot)\r\n4\r\nDevelopment of harvestable vegetative plant parts or vegetatively propagated organs / booting (main shoot)\r\n5\r\nInflorescence emergence\r\n6\r\nFlowering (main shoot)\r\n7\r\nDevelopment of fruit\r\n8\r\nRipening or maturity of fruit and seed\r\n9\r\nSenescence, beginning of dormancy\r\nFor a comprehensive overview of phenology and the BBCH scale, the video Phenology by Dr. Erica Fadón is recommended. In this video, Dr. Fadón explains the concept of phenology and how the BBCH scale uses numerical codes to represent the different developmental stages of trees, from budding and flowering to fruit ripening and leaf fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcercises on tree dormancy\r\nPut yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer.\r\nAs a breeder aiming to calculate the temperature requirements for the chilling and forcing periods of a newly released cultivar, I would use the experimental method to determine the chilling and forcing periods. Here’s my justification:\r\nDirect measurement of bud response: The experimental method allows me to directly observe when buds break under controlled temperature conditions. By regularly collecting buds during winter and placing them in ideal growth conditions, I can determine exactly when dormancy ends. This practical approach gives me quick and useful information about the specific cultivar\r\nSpecific to the cultivar: Each cultivar has its own unique chilling and forcing needs. The experimental method looks at the specific traits of the new cultivar, making sure the results are relevant and applicable to that variety\r\nImmediate results for breeding decisions: The experimental method provides quick evaluations of bud break, allowing me to make faster decisions about breeding and managing the new cultivar\r\nWhich are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlier scales?\r\nStandardization: The BBCH scale provides a standardized framework for describing plant growth stages, enabling consistent communication and comparisons across studies\r\nDetailed Staging: It offers a more granular categorization of developmental stages using a two-digit system, allowing for a better understanding of plant development and environmental impacts.\r\nClassify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:\r\n\r\nleft image: BBCH stage 55 (single flower buds visible (still closed), green scales slightly open)\r\nmiddle image: BBCH stage 65 (full flowering: at least 50% of flowers open, first petals falling)\r\nright image: BBCH stage 89 (fruit ripe for harvesting)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThis section provides an overview of how winter chill can be modeled. It summarizes past studies on this topic, aiming to clarify the methodological aspects that lead to the analyses conducted. By the end of this lesson, most of the analyses presented in the discussed papers should be understandable.\r\nWinter chill in Oman\r\nDuring his doctoral studies at the University of Kassel, Prof. Dr. Eike Lüdeling became interested in winter chill while participating in research on mountain oases in Oman. Initially focused on calculating nutrient budgets for the oases, particularly in the “Hanging Gardens” of Ash Sharayjah, the study shifted when many fruit trees failed to bear fruit. This led to the hypothesis that insufficient winter chill might be the issue, especially since the oases hosted temperate species such as pomegranates (Punica granatum), walnuts (Juglans regia), and apricots (Prunus armeniaca).\r\nTo investigate this, temperature loggers were placed in three oases at different levels of elevation, allowing for the study of chill accumulation along an elevation gradient. A map of the study area illustrates the locations of the oases:\r\nMap of oasis systems in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, OmanA nearby long-term weather station provided valuable data, although its location - 1000 meters above the lowest oasis - limited its representativeness. Since records were available from the oases, transfer functions were defined to derive oasis temperatures from the long-term data. These transfer functions were set up using PLS regression, which, in hindsight, wasn’t a very good idea, to directly calculate hourly temperatures in the oases from the daily records of the official station at Saiq.\r\nRegression between temperature at Saiq and temperature in three oases, Al Jabal Al Akhdar, OmanThis approach facilitated the calculation of hourly temperatures, which were essential for assessing winter chill dynamics over several years.\r\nChill dynamics between 1983 and 2007, Al Jabal Al Akhdar, OmanThe findings were submitted to the journal Climatic Change (Luedeling et al., 2009b), where reviewers suggested incorporating future climate scenarios. To address this, the LARS-WG weather generator was employed to simulate plausible weather conditions for the oases under scenarios of 1°C and 2°C warming.\r\nChill prospects for 1°C and 2°C warming scenarios in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, OmanThe results illustrated the potential impacts of climate change on winter chill, marking the beginning of a career focused on chill modeling.\r\nChill model sensitivity\r\nAfter completing a PhD at the University of Kassel, Prof. Dr. Eike Lüdeling became a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California at Davis, where his research focused on climate change impacts on winter chill in California’s Central Valley, a key region for temperate fruit tree production.\r\nUpon arriving in California, it became evident that the choice of chill model significantly impacts winter chill quantification. Initially, the simplest model was chosen due to a lack of programming skills, but further investigation highlighted the importance of model selection. Extensive library research revealed the need for a thorough examination of various chill models. Knowledge gained in Oman was utilized to create temperature scenarios for multiple locations, allowing for the analysis of how chill accumulation would likely change in the future.\r\nThe analysis focused on changes predicted by various models for the same locations and future scenarios. Here are the locations examined:\r\nWeather station locations in CaliforniaThe results revealed considerable variation in chill projections for these locations. The analysis illustrated significant differences in estimates of chill losses by 2050, indicating that not all models could accurately represent winter chill dynamics. Ultimately, the Dynamic Model emerged as the most reliable option, prompting its primary use in subsequent research.\r\nSensitivity of chill projections to model choice (CH - Chilling Hours; Utah - Utah Model; Utah+ - Positive Utah Model; Port. - Dynamic Model)However, challenges arose with the complexity of the Dynamic Model, which required outdated Excel software for calculations. Additionally, the data processing steps necessary to generate credible temperature scenarios proved cumbersome and error-prone, highlighting the need to develop programming skills for more efficient analysis.\r\nWinter chill in California\r\nThe primary goal during the time in California was to create a winter chill projection for the Central Valley, an important region for fruit and nut production. Utilizing California’s extensive network of weather stations, the plan involved using data from over 100 stations and generating multiple climate scenarios. To manage this complex task efficiently, a decision was made to automate most processes, leading to an exploration of programming.\r\nThe automation was implemented using JSL, a programming language associated with the statistics software JMP, which facilitated the handling of the data. Despite some challenges, the automation was largely successful, though running the weather generator manually for each station remained tedious. Ultimately, projections were generated for all stations, illustrating chill accumulation over 100 plausible winter seasons for each climate scenario.\r\nTo present the results effectively, a metric called ‘Safe Winter Chill’ was developed, defined as the 10th percentile of the chill distribution, indicating the minimum chill amount that would be exceeded in 90% of the years. Here’s an illustration of the Safe Winter Chill metric:\r\nIllustration of the Safe Winter Chill conceptA method for spatially interpolating the station results was also established, leading to the creation of maps that depicted winter chill prospects for the Central Valley. Here’s one of the maps that resulted from this:\r\nWinter chill prospects for California’s Central ValleyThis analysis was published in the journal PLOS ONE (Luedeling et al., 2009d).\r\nWinter chill ratios\r\nFollowing the automation of processing steps in JSL, attention turned to creating a global winter chill projection. The Global Summary of the Day database was identified as a valuable data source, featuring records from thousands of weather stations. The project proved challenging due to limited programming skills. Data processing was carried out on six computers operating around the clock for several weeks, likely a result of initial setup difficulties rather than the complexity of the analyses. In the end, data for about 5,000 weather stations were processed, generating multiple chill metrics.\r\nThis extensive dataset allowed for a comparison of chill models by calculating the ratios between various chill metrics at each station. If these ratios had been consistent worldwide (e.g., one Chill Portion always equating to ten Chilling Hours), any chill model could have been reliably used. However, significant variations in chill metric ratios were observed globally.\r\nChill metric ratios around the worldThis study was published in the International Journal of Biometeorology (Luedeling & Brown, 2011a).\r\nA global projection of future winter chill\r\nUsing the same analytical methods, a global projection of the potential impacts of climate change on winter chill was also generated:\r\nProjected decline in available winter chill around the worldThe regions marked in red and orange on the lower two maps may experience significant impacts on fruit and nut production due to decreasing winter chill. With substantial chill losses, it is unlikely that growers will be able to sustain their current tree cultivars. Notably, the Mediterranean region is expected to be particularly affected.\r\nWinter chill projection for the Mediterranean regionThis prompted collaboration with partners in the Mediterranean region and other countries with similar climates, such as South Africa and Chile.\r\nWinter chill in Germany\r\nGermany is not highlighted as particularly vulnerable to chill losses, and an analysis of historical chilling trends from 1950 supports this observation:\r\nWinter chill in Germany in 2010, and changes between 1950 and 2010Winter chill in Tunisia\r\nProspects for orchards in Tunisia are particularly challenging due to the region being close to the warmest limits for many fruit and nut tree species. An assessment published in 2018 examined past and future trends in winter chill for an orchard in Central Tunisia, following a seven-year gap from earlier studies. This delay stemmed from other professional commitments and the difficulty of obtaining suitable future climate data for chill modeling.\r\nWhile climate change data is widely available, much of it is presented as spatial grids, making it cumbersome to work with. Each climate scenario requires numerous grids for temperature and rainfall, leading to substantial data storage needs, sometimes exceeding 700 GB. Soon after establishing a processing structure for these datasets, the IPCC introduced the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), rendering earlier scenarios outdated and complicating the analysis further, especially given the limited data transfer capabilities while based in Kenya.\r\nCollaboration with colleagues in Tunisia, particularly Haifa Benmoussa, revealed that tree crops like almonds and pistachios are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Fortunately, a new climate database specifically for Africa, called AFRICLIM, was developed, facilitating the acquisition and processing of relevant climate scenarios. This allowed for the incorporation of new functions in chillR to sample from AFRICLIM grids and produce the necessary climate projections.\r\nWinter chill analysis for an orchard near Sfax in Central Tunisia (blue bars indicate approximate chilling requirements of pistachios and two types of almonds)The figure, which is to be created by the end of the semester, illustrates the historical development of chill accumulation at a specific location, with observed values represented by red dots and typical chill distributions shown as boxplots. These data were generated using a weather generator that is calibrated with historical weather data and produces artificial annual weather records. The generator was also used to create future scenarios based on the AFRICLIM database.\r\nThe analysis indicates that in none of the future scenarios does the cultivation of pistachios or high-chill almonds remain viable. This conclusion is supported by observations in Tunisia, where, after the warm winter of 2015/16, many pistachio trees barely developed any flowers, leading to crop failures.\r\nPistachio tree near Sfax, Central Tunisia, in April of 2016Winter chill in Chile\r\nAFRICLIM addressed the challenge of obtaining future climate data for Africa but did not fully meet the needs for integrating climate change projections into chillR. It was limited to African data, and users seeking information for single locations had to download large datasets, which was inefficient. A more effective solution was needed to access data quickly for individual weather stations globally.\r\nAn early resource was ClimateWizard, developed by Evan Girvetz, which initially provided gridded data but later included a script for extracting information for specific locations. This functionality was eventually made available through an API at CIAT, allowing access to outputs from 15 climate models for the latest RCP scenarios. This advancement enabled Eduardo Fernández to analyze past and future chill development across nine locations in Chile, expanding the geographic scope of the research.\r\nMap of fruit growing locations in ChileThe following diagram illustrates the assessment of past and future winter chill across nine locations in Chile:\r\nAssessment of past and future winter chill for 9 locations across ChileEduardo preferred a different plot design and utilized the ggplot2 package, a robust plotting tool for R, to redesign it. The complexity of having data from multiple sites made interpretation challenging, prompting Eduardo to creatively summarize key information for each scenario. He presented this information as a heat map, simplifying the visualization.\r\nHeatmap showing Safe Winter Chill (10% quantile of chill distribution) for nine locations in ChileChill projection for Patagonia\r\nCertain regions may become more suitable for agriculture as the climate changes. An analysis was conducted to assess the climatic suitability for fruit and nut trees in Patagonia, southern Argentina, which is located at the southern frontier of agriculture:\r\nMap of parts of Patagonia in Argentina, showing locations that were analyzed in this studyWeather station records for all locations on the map were obtained, enabling the calibration of a weather generator and the download of climate projections from the ClimateWizard database. This facilitated the creation of past and future temperature scenarios for all stations, as well as the computation of winter chill and other agroclimatic metrics. However, the results of the winter chill calculations were not particularly noteworthy, as minimal changes were projected.\r\nHeatmap showing Safe Winter Chill (10% quantile of chill distribution) for eleven locations in PatagoniaClimate change could potentially enhance land suitability for fruit trees by providing increased summer heat:\r\nPast and projected future heat availability for four exemplary locations in PatagoniaA further beneficial development is a likely reduction in the number of frost hours:\r\nPast and projected frost risk for four exemplary locations in PatagoniaWhile the changes observed may appear minor, they are likely to shift many locations from a climate that is too cool for agriculture, particularly for fruit trees, to a more optimal situation. This presents a rare instance of potentially positive news related to climate change, though it is important to acknowledge that these changes could have negative consequences for natural ecosystems and other agricultural systems.\r\nChill model comparison\r\nEduardo Fernandez recently utilized the climate change analysis framework to enhance previous chill model comparisons, significantly building on earlier work. He compiled a collection of 13 methods for quantifying chill accumulation from existing literature and applied these models to datasets from several locations in Germany, Tunisia, and Chile, which are part of the PASIT project. A map illustrates the locations included in this analysis.\r\nLocations used for comparing predictions by a total of 13 chill models across different climatesThe expectation was that the models would show significant differences in the extent of changes they predicted, and this anticipation was indeed fulfilled:\r\nChill change projections by a total of 13 chill models across different climate scenariosThe figure illustrates the changes predicted by 13 different models across various sites and climate scenarios, categorized into three groups: warm, moderate, and cool. Eduardo’s analysis reveals significant discrepancies among the models, highlighting the risks of selecting the most convenient model for predictions. The variation in predictions is evident in the color distribution across the rows of the panels, with a uniform color indicating consistency among models—something that is not observed here.\r\nFor locations in Tunisia and Chile, the predictions mainly concern the extent of chill losses, ranging from mild to alarming. In Germany, the situation is even less clear, with some models predicting increases in chill and others predicting decreases.\r\nThese findings underscore the importance of model choice, as many models may be arbitrary and can be disregarded, yet uncertainties remain regarding which models accurately represent future conditions. This area of research offers opportunities for further exploration and innovation.\r\nChill projection for all of Tunisia\r\nThe study projected climate change impacts on winter chill for an orchard near Sfax in Central Tunisia, but the region is not the most favorable for temperate fruit and nut tree cultivation. Tunisia is climatically diverse, featuring mountains, plains, coastal areas, and interior deserts, leading to significant variation in historical and future chill availability across the country.\r\nUnder the leadership of Haifa Benmoussa, the team mapped chill accumulation throughout Tunisia using a framework previously developed. This analysis utilized data from 20 weather stations in Tunisia and neighboring countries. By applying the established analytical framework to each location, they were able to interpolate results and create chill maps that illustrate the trends in chill availability in Tunisia over the past few decades:\r\nChill availability maps for Tunisia for several past scenariosThe process of interpolating site-specific results into a comprehensive map for Tunisia involves some areas for improvement. Currently, the methodology uses site-specific predictions of Safe Winter Chill, defined as the 10th percentile of the chill distribution derived from annual temperature dynamics generated by the weather model. This information is then interpolated using the Kriging technique.\r\nIn addition, the elevations of the locations where chill was modeled are also considered. A linear model is fitted to establish a relationship between chill accumulation and elevation. Using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the differences between the model-derived elevations from weather stations and the actual elevations of each location are calculated. This difference, not accounted for in the initial chill surface derived from weather station data, is corrected using the established elevation-chill relationship.\r\nWhile this method seems reasonable for Tunisia, it may not be suitable for cooler regions like Germany, where the relationship between elevation and chill availability may not be linear. The resulting projection of future chill for Tunisia is displayed in the following map:\r\nChill availability for Tunisia for various plausible scenarios of future climateThe projections reveal significant concern regarding winter chill in Tunisia. The Dynamic Model, which is regarded as a reliable predictor, indicates substantial decreases in Chill Portions, the units used by the model. This trend poses serious challenges for much of the country. Even in areas where some winter chill is expected to persist, farmers will need to adapt their practices, as the tree species currently cultivated are suited to past climate conditions. Adaptation strategies may include shifting to tree cultivars with lower chilling requirements, provided such options are available.\r\nRevisiting chill accumulation in Oman\r\nAfter a decade of exploration in other regions, the analysis turned back to Oman, where there was a desire to enhance the initial study of chill accumulation. The first assessment had limitations, particularly concerning model selection and a lack of adequate future climate data. With encouragement from Prof. Dr. Andreas Bürkert, a more robust evaluation became possible using the climate change analysis framework. This involved incorporating new methods to convert daily temperatures into hourly data. Updated assessments of past winter chill and future forecasts for the oases of Al Jabal Al Akhdar were produced, with the findings published in Climatic Change (Buerkert et al., 2020).\r\nExercises on past chill projections\r\nSketch out three data access and processing challenges that had to be overcome in order to produce chill projections with state-of-the-art methodology.\r\nAccessing Climate Data for Specific Locations:\r\nPrevious climate datasets like AFRICLIM and ClimateWizard only provided large-scale data. To get weather data for specific locations without downloading too much extra information, an API was created to quickly access data for single sites\r\nConverting Daily to Hourly Temperature Data:\r\nChill models need hourly temperature data, but many databases only give daily averages. Early methods for converting daily to hourly data weren’t very good, especially in areas with unique temperatures. Improved algorithms were developed to estimate hourly temperatures more accurately from daily data\r\nHandling Large Volumes of Climate Model Outputs:\r\nStudying different climate futures involves dealing with a lot of data from many climate models, which can be hard to manage. To handle this large amount of data effectively, workflows were streamlined and selective processing techniques were used\r\nOutline, in your understanding, the basic steps that are necessary to make such projections.\r\nTo make climate-based chill projections for specific regions, here are the essential steps typically involved:\r\nData Collection and Calibration: collect historical weather data and use it to calibrate a weather generator for realistic temperature simulations\r\nModel Selection and Scenario Setup: choose relevant climate models and emission scenarios to explore various future climates\r\nGenerate Temperature Projections: downscale climate data, converting it to daily or hourly temperatures as needed for chill calculations\r\nChill Calculation: apply chill models to estimate chill accumulation across different climate scenarios\r\nAnalysis and Visualization: compare chill projections across models and scenarios and visualize the findings\r\nInterpretation: validate projections with observed data where possible and assess agricultural impacts and adaptation needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
