# Introduction to the Module

Hi, my name is Jacqueline. I’m a master’s student in Crop Sciences at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de). This is my learning logbook for the module “Tree phenology analysis with R”. This module provides an overview of methods to study the impact of climate and climate change on tree phenology. It is designed for those who may not yet be familiar with phenology or how to analyze climate change effects, but it also aims to offer new insights for those with existing knowledge in these areas. Initially developed for M.Sc. students in Crop Science and Agricultural Science and Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics (ARTS) at the University of Bonn, the material is accessible to anyone interested.

The content begins with an introduction to phenology (with a special emphasis on dormancy) as well as an overview of climate change. It then focuses heavily on the practical application of the `chillR` package for R. This tool has been continuously developed since 2013 by [Prof. Dr. Eike Lüdeling](https://www.gartenbauwissenschaften.uni-bonn.de/en/staff/eike-luedeling), head of the HortiBonn research group at the [Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES)](https://www.inres.uni-bonn.de/de) at the University of Bonn, to support this type of analysis.

## Learning goals

This course will offer the following skills and experiences:

-   Knowledge about phenology
-   Knowledge about tree dormancy
-   Understanding of climate change impact projection methods
-   Appreciation for the importance of risks and uncertainty in climate change projection
-   Understanding of how to use some staple tools of R code development
-   Ability to use `chillR` functions for climate change impact projection
-   Ability to use `chillR` functions for tree phenology analysis
-   Understanding and ability to use the `PhenoFlex` dormancy analysis framework
